# The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:

- Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
- Use a combination of Excel functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).
- Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel.
- Create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel to create a financial forecast model.
